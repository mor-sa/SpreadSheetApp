This is a SpreadSheetApp created for my Operating Systems class.

I've used a file written for the assignment to allow many users (threads) interact in a sharable spread sheet.

It contains usage of locks, both mutex and semaphores.

In the GUI Application I've used: DataGridView, OpenFileDialog and SaveFileDialog.

The operations that can be done with the application: 

Load - load a spreadsheet in .dat format.

SetCell - choose a cell and change it's value.

GetCell - shows the value in the cell.

Save - saves the new spreadsheet in .dat format
